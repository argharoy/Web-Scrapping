It\u2019s the standard chocolate Oreo we all know and we all love, except for the folks who made Hydrox, and in between the wafers is a brownie batter-flavored creme.Before trying these, I wondered how different they would taste compared with Chocolate Oreo Cookies and their Jedi robe brown-colored creme. So I did something I rarely do. I bought a package of regular Chocolate Oreo.(Seriously, including the package I bought for this review, I believe I\u2019ve only purchase Chocolate Oreo twice in my life.) And after trying the two, I have to say Brownie Batter Oreo is much better.The extremely busy labcoat-wearing folks in the Nabisco test kitchens did a wonderful job with these cookies. The aroma that comes out of the package after opening it smells like brownie batter, and it also reminds me of the hot fudge on a McDonald\u2019s sundae. The creme itself tastes like I\u2019m risking the chance of getting salmonella by licking clean a wooden spoon covered with prepared brownie mix. It has a richer and fudgier flavor than the Chocolate Oreo creme. It\u2019s delightful and I\u2019d recommend licking it, if you\u2019re into that.But the chocolate wafers do get in the way of the brownie batter creme. When eaten whole, I taste more of the wafers than the creme. But it does get a bit more noticeable in the aftertaste. Of course, if you were to eat these in an unconventional way, with one of the wafers removed, the brownie batter flavor definitely stands out.If you love licking brownie batter off a spoon or, if you\u2019re civilized, run your finger along the spoon\u2019s head to get some of that brownie batter goodness, I think you\u2019ll love the flavor of these Limited Edition Brownie Batter Oreo Cookies.(Nutrition Facts \u2013 2 cookies \u2013 140 calories, 60 calories from fat, 6 grams of fat, 2 grams of saturated fat, 0 grams of trans fat, 0 milligrams of cholesterol, 100 milligrams of sodium, 70 milligrams of potassium, 20 grams of carbohydrates, less than 1 gram of fiber, 13 grams of sugar, 1 gram of protein.)Item: Limited Edition Brownie Batter Oreo CookiesPurchased Price: N/ASize: 10.7 oz.Purchased at: N/ARating: 8 out of 10Pros: That brownie batter creme is wonderful.

If you are looking for that lovingly home baked taste you really have come to the wrong place.So what can I say about the Oreo as a biscuit other than its capitalist credentials? Well its main ingredient is sugar and it consists of two rather sickly dark cocoa biscuits, bearing the company logo, back to back with some white sugary creme stuff in between. Variants are available where the creme is flavored with coffee, mint etc. There are also ones that have been covered in fudge of various types. Can you feel your arteries hardening as you read this?The pack absurdly comes with eating instructions, of which there are six stages. I won't detail them all but basically you are encouraged to wrench the thing into its component parts. What is the point of assembling it in the first place if you have to take it all to bits to eat it? Well I'm assuming this is what Altria refers to as \"Marketing Excellence: Expertise and imagination applied by our consumer packaged goods companies in the development of outstanding consumer brands.\" This statement is number two on the list of what Atria stands for.I'm also gratified to see that the pack describes the contents as biscuits not cookies.Thanks.", "gojosh889": " This Cookies are like the most tastiest and simplest cookies in the world.They are so good that they are used in Cafe coffee day as crushed oreos on their coffee.That is when I became a fan of this product and started using it on my home-made coffees to get that same taste.Oreo basically comes in two flavors .first is the vanilla flavor and the other one is the chocolate flavor .Both are equally good.These cookies have more cream than that of products like dark fantasy.Using Milk to dip is also a good choice to consume the product. The product is quite cheap for the taste it provides .It only about 15 Rs for a pack.I have a best way of eating this cookie. I usually buy both the flavors together and eat it mixing both the creams together(don't work its not disgusting .I just remove the biscuit containing he cream and join it with the other flavor .Its has a good taste .trust me.

I don't like this product much, but I do like that Oreo doughnut when I visit mad Over Donuts or'Cookies n' cream' Amul Ice Cream in the variety of many flavors.So, it earns good marks in my books, but they are just too pricey and expensive so I'd either gift them or receive them as gifts, but would never eat them at my own expense.Be India.

One is vanilla and the other is strawberry.They are available in Rs. 10 and Rs. 30 packs. Oreo is loved not just by, but so many people. This is evident because of the number of desserts it's included in, wherever I go. At the cake shops, you will find a cake with Oreo decoration or fillings. At the ice cream parlour, again there ice creams and shakes that have the option of including Oreo crushings. At Mc Donald's the fantastic Mc Flurry is also accompanied with Oreo crushings.Food industries should manufacture more biscuits like these.", "prayaga1989": " Oreo my all time favorite biscuits and my lovely time pass. everyday this is my start up breakfast with milk. they taste so yummy that even the last biscuit tastes so better.

Another favourite of my mine was the Britannia jimjam which had biscuit and cream, jam and sugar in the middle.When oreo was launched ivsaw the ads and wanted to try it out. So at first I tried the chocolate oreo and it was great. Its so much better than other chocolate cream biscuits. Another flavour I tried was the vanilla and its just as bad as the chocolate one is great. Later after sometime strawberry flavour was released and its too as good as the chocolate one.The quality and the taste in oreo biscuits is so much better than the other biscuits. You can genuinely taste the chocolate and strawberry and its so much balanced and perfect. The biscuits are pricier than the other ones like 30 rs for 10 pieces in a packet.So I would recommend this oreo biscuits for everyone to try and decide for yourself. Only the chocolate and strawberry flavours are great but definitely avoid the vanilla flavour. I like them and would rate it 5 in terms of flavour, quality and quantity.", "Manizem": " Oreo cookies are from heaven, certainly no doubt about that. One bite of the highly calorific delight and you are ready to plunge greedily into the entire pack .However, one of the newly launched flavors 'peanut butter..' is not what I would exactly call 'from heaven..''.To put it as subtly as possible, it tastes weird\u00a0and for the lovers of the original, parent Oreo cookie, the one with the rich white cream which tantalizingly melts in your mouth, this particular flavor will come as a grim disappointment. Believe me, it did not taste like peanut butter, the layer of cream was disappointingly thin and the whole experience just left me feeling a bit glum. The fact that one has to shell out five bucks extra will no doubt make you cringe after your first bite!!!!!Infact\u00a0I don\u2019t remember an Oreo pack that lasts five minutes after opening it.

I am a die-hard lover of Oreo biscuits because they taste heavenly. Vanilla flavor is my favorite as I am not a strawberry fan. Vanilla cream in between chocolate wrapped cookies, what else would you want? The small packet cost 10 rs and you have 5 biscuits inside, which is perfect for a snack. It tastes all the more good if you have it with milk, plain milk because the sugar quotient is already high in the biscuit. You can have it for breakfast or evening snack and one packet is enough to suffice one person.The strawberry flavor is also a good attempt but failed to impress me because the combination of strawberry with chocolate itself does not go well. Nevertheless, the taste is not that bad.", "ridhima445": " These biscuits are worth giving a shot. There are number of dishes you can prepare using the oreo. I personally love the Oreo Milksake, so smooth so creme. The creme really does feel and taste like cream cheese frosting.

I tried them multiple times hoping that I will realize that they are as good as every one says. But no, still did not like them.In-fact they do not even taste good on their own. Their biscuits are very dry and hard to bite and their cream isn't anything special either. Yes dunking them in milk does helps and greatly increase the flavor but what I am supposed to do when I am not home and I do not have milk?I think its all marketing and plain over-hyping a product. Now they even use Ranbir Kapoor in their advertising, good for them! Verdict: You will not die if you eat it, but there is nothing special about them as well!There are much yummier cookies available out there.", "murgandev": " Just now when I was having my tea I just felt having something light with my tea and my daughter passed me her OREO cookies.

Mass psychology at work or is it something more sinister?The taste is average, the price pricey and the packaging, as someone suggested, could have been better to avoid crumbling inside.The TV ads are super duper though - the playing of the little girl with her papa kind of touches the chord."}]
