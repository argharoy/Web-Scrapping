I don\u2019t say that there are not better biscuits that Parle G, but there is something unique about it, that appeals to everyone. First they are simple biscuits, they don\u2019t have a chocolate paste or any other thing inside them. And they do not taste very sweet, they are just the right taste for your tongue, that is the reason that they are liked by every age group.Parle G can be eaten with other snacks. They compliment tea and coffee, but I lie to dip them in water and have them, and they really taste yummy that way.A small pack of Parle G cost have around 10 12 biscuits in it, and it comes at a cheap price of 5 Rs. Recently they have also introduced a mini pack with costs Rs 2 and have 5 pieces. Everyone in my family like to have them for their simple taste, and although we have other brands in market that are good too, but still Parle G is a bit nostalgic for me!

I have seen this happening when I buy biscuits from ambarnath also.. there is a factory in ambarnath midc in Ambarnath...so may be there is an issue over there also...but I guess it is worth checking on this as I guess sooner or later people are going to notice this varying taste when\u00a0 they notice this when people sitting in groups with the small packs...we did notice this when we all friends in office were having biscuits from different packs and the difference was very evident...", "bhavyasai4": " TO MANAGER OF PARLE G,SUB:TO_ INCREASE_SALES_ BY_SMALL TIP.MY NAME IS BHAVYA SAI STUDYING 2nd B-TECH IN NRIIT NEAR GUNTUR, ANDHRA- PRADESH, INDIA .I HAVE A SMALL IDEA WITH ME THAT CAN HELP U\u00a0\u00a0TO RISE U'R SALES IN OUR COUNTRY.IT DOESNT REQUIRED ANY CAPITAL TO IMPLEMENT IT AND IT'S GOING TO REDUCE UR COST OF MANUFACTUREING.AS PARLE G IS ABISCUIT PRODUCT IT HAVE A LOT OF CHILDREN ATTENTION AND THEY MUST LIKE IT AND THEY MUST FEEL IT NICE TO BUY IT\u00a0\u00a0BY KEEPING UR BELIFE OVER ME TO KNOW ABOUT THE IDEA MAKE A MAIL TO\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.BHAVYASAI4@GMAIL.COMYOURS FAITHFUIIBHAVYA SAI BODAPATHI", "SG21": " Introduction: India is a land of culture and heritage (Accha Beta!

If you have seen a movie \"Family\", then you may recall Amitabh Bacchan (Sai) brings his grandson \"Parle G\" as his gift and he proudly announces \"Dekho aapke liye hum kya laaye hein? Duniya ke sabse favorite biscuits - Parle G!\" In a recent movie, somebody remarked, we love it so much that we inserted a \"G\" as a mark of our respect! Yes, its rectangular crisp biscuit (Kut nahin Kit), on the pack of Parle G its written -  World's Largest Selling Biscuit, Original Gluco Biscuits, Milk + Wheat!Specific Details: Ingredients - Wheat Flour, Edible Oil, Sugar, Invert Syrup (Abey Seedha hi daal deta!), Leavening Agents (Agent Vinod will join soon), Emulsifiers, Dough Conditioner (not Dove Conditioner) and Antioxidants (Har cheez ab mein yahi daalo!). It is manufactured by Ramkrishna Bakers, Kanpur (Yes, I was also shocked, maybe a local manufacturer for distribution in UP) and marketed by Parle Biscuits, Mumbai. You can feel a little difference in taste in what is being supplied in Maharastra compared with the same product in other states. In Mumbai, the entire vicinity of the factory is named after Parle factory i.e. Vile Parle and you can actually make out that you are in VParle(E) sensing the Glucose+Vanilla fragrance filling up your nose.Some psychotherapists must have suggested Amul as well as Parle to use the picture of child on its product. Yes, I agree with them. There is a child in me too and YOU too! (Don't panic Women! Don't rush for Pregasure! Its just one level of transactional analysis) And, please don't lick it. Its not a cream biscuit. Just a quick dip in a cup of tea and eat it before it demonstrate a free fall. If you need an innovation, try dipping two to three biscuits together. Try stuffing it with the home made butter in between. Enjoy the feel of say club sandwich.By the way, this child on the wrapper looks so cute and too real! Check the photos tagged along. I am not discussing the nutritional part but have seen many mummies giving one biscuit to their 2-3 year old kids. And, the baby keeps eating it for say half an hour or so!

We imported one shipment from them. We got a Trade Mark on the name of Parle to protect us. When we asked them for the second shipment, they threatened us that they would withdraw stock, unless we withdrew our Trade Mark.Our buyer told us that that would happen. They destroyed our business by withdrawing stock. After a few years, they stealthily got their biscuits into small Indian stores in Australia and contravened our Trade Mark.Then they put up a case against us with IP Australia. We could not afford legal backing. They used expensive legal firms. We fought the case and lost. Today they are now claiming $2795 from us !These Companies make you do work for them for free and use you and once you get their products in, they intimidate you so they can supply directly to the large Companies.

Irony of the situation is that neither is one that hungry to eat a full wada or dosa or sandwitch and neither is there much of urge, but its simply the temptation to have somethin with tea or just bcoz a friend is eating somethin tht u also wanna eat. however, this kills one's hunger and so either lunches are skipped or wasted or eaten half way and half heartedly. but recently the tea stall guy started keeping Parle-G's small pack costing Rs.2/- now thts a boon and relief, since munching tht biscuit has always been a pleasure since childhood, also it goes well with tea/coffee plus its easy on the pocket and keeps my hunger alive and above all saves me from those fatty unhealthy food. parle G have always tasted good and have been quite filling, and now those tear wrapper packing is also a gift, its easy and in fact fun to open, believe me!!", "anita_123": " Hi Friends,I would like to share one experience which I had with Parle Company.Really Parle G** is a good company who is providing different varieties of biscuits among all.When I was in 10th Standard our school had taken us for Picnic to this company, where they shown us how they are making this biscuits and how they bake and wrap it.

The markets are flooded with biscuits of every taste and for every age group. Sometimes it would be just difficult for us to decide on what to go for. These are good combinations with a hot cup of Tea or a coffee. They make a quick and a tasty snack any time and in any situation.Glucose biscuits are mainly the favourites of many as their intake charges them up. Specially if a person is suffering from Low BP, then these glucose biscuits act as energizers in emergencies. People suffering from Diabetes too carry them to increase the glucose level in their body . Besides the delicious taste that it offers, it is highly helpful for people suffering from the above 2 illness who take it for reasons beyond its taste.A cream coloured yellow stripped wrapper with a cute baby photo containing 10 \u2013 12 biscuits  with the company\u2019s name printed in Red and you know these are Parle G biscuits. Times changed, variety of biscuits did come and go but nothing has changed with these biscuits.  Yes, the size of their packing has definitely changed but for the consumers good as these are money savers pack. The taste of these biscuits never changed since the time I tasted them to till date. My morning tea is always combined with these biscuits. Over a period of time I have got a feeling that these 3 small biscuits make me work energetically both at home and at the work place the whole day.Parle G biscuits are always stocked at my place for my kids who relish them happily and also for those demanding kid guests when they come to my place. For my 8 year old son, these biscuits are a constant favourite. Occasionally he switches over to some other brand, that is when he sees some of his friends munching at school but then he is back at his old favourite. And same is the case with my 18 months old daughter. She would come to me pointing towards the jar where these biscuits are stocked. As a mother it\u2019s a joy to see my children relishing them with joy. At times these biscuits keep away my headaches because the sight of these biscuits lightens up the face of my little one who would otherwise cry constantly for some thing or the other.My kids require no reason or occasion to munch their favourite biscuits. But these biscuits go very well with any age group. Its soft and sweet taste is preferred alike by everybody. Moreover it is enriched with the nutritional value which makes it all the more wanted. Above all it is very fair to the wallets too which is again an added advantage.I recalled an incident that took place some time back. Once my husband was down with fever for more than 15 days.The doctors as usual diagnosed something else and gave him the wrong medication. This made him very weak. No amount of lime juice or Glucon D packets could revive his energy. So to enlighten his mood we went to our cousin\u2019s place where his cousin offered him Parle G and suddenly he felt the change. What I was unable to do Parle G did..! Since then Parle G is stocked at my place. And I have been a constant admirer of this brand for some emotional reasons mentioned just above.Now going back to its history : Parle began its production in 1939 even before India\u2019s independence. Today Parle enjoys 40% of the total biscuit market and 15 % of the total confectionary market in India. Besides Parle G, Parle offers Parle Monaco, Parle Krackjack varieties in biscuits and in confectionary items it offers melody, kismi, poppins and mangobite.  :The Parle brands have been constantly honoured internationally with the awards at the Monde Selection.

Dip Dip Dip.....that's what the Taj Mahal Tea Bags ad said a few years ago.I took it for everything that could be dipped into tea... biscuit, bread, paratha, even pakora's... until I finally learnt a lesson the hard way.... I dipped tomato sauce in my tea and ended up with a severely upset stomach... not to mention upset mom and dad!While I stopped tea dipping instantly, there is one thing that I cannot resist dipping into my cup of tea even today..... Parle G!Every Sunday morning I devour an entire pack alongwith my bed tea. I have been doing this ever since I can remember. And I cannot remember the taste ever changing. Its the same crisp, sweet flour that I have feasted on every Sunday of my life.
