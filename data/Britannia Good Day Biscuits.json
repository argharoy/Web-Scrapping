Both refined flour and sugar(which form the bulk of the biscuit) are bad for our health. But luckily this biscuit does not contain hydrogenatedvegetable fat which is unhealthy, but just vegetable oil, which means no transfats.It\u2019s said that naturally occurring transfat(found in dairy products and some meats) is not harmful  but artificially produced transfats as in hydrogenated vegetable oils are extremely bad for health and are a factor in causing heart disease.Gooday also contains nuts, butter, milk solids, but they are present in tiny quantities and in any case all are highly processed.As such they are not as nutritious as they would be in their natural form.

I have always wondered what is so special about this time, but have never been able to figure it out. There could be several reasons may be because tea time is close to finishing hours at work. But I have enjoyed my work and have never looked at the watch waiting to finish work. May be work tires me and therefore makes me look forward to the hot steaming cup of tea to freshen up. But its not just tea that energizes me, coz at times when I have had tea at my desk..it has not really boosted me as much as when I have it with my colleagues. May be I am looking for company and the normal gathering that happens during the short tea break is what makes it so interesting. There is another reason - Good day cashew biscuits to go with the tea.After all tea is no good without biscuits. Goodday biscuits were not really my favourite ones. I would love the salty ones, but with no time and thanks to my friends, the taste of goodday biscuits grew on me. Now I am hooked on to the taste. We have it in the most Indian style, dip the biscuits into the tea and then bite into the soggy biscuits. Is there a better way to have the biscuits?

Iluv them but they do the worst things to my insides so I hve to restrict my intake, which is just not possible with most of the Good Day biscuits. U know?

Couldn't resist so took it home and tried it and hey I FELL IN LOVE !!Chocolate: Plenty and very original flavourNuts : plenty , crispBiscuit: crispish-chewy. If you like your biscuits very crisp keep the packet in the butter box of the refrigeratorfor an hour and then try. The flavour of the choco doesn't change like in chocolates. [i prefer chocos thawed out]For Moms: Use it as a reward for good behaviour, grades, incentives etc.For hubbies: Present her with a pack whenever u want to 'patao' her.For the elderly: treat yourself to one a day -but only with your meals. This is no ordinary cookie-packed with calories(50 per biscuit), fats(3.2g - that's 30 % of each cookie), nuts, maida. Its bound to set your lipid profile into a tizzy.For housewives: Same as above (we really live a sedentary life). 10 in a pack of 100g.Joh bhi ho. Par CHODNA MAT!! It?s the closest thing to my mom?s chocochip cookies.", "arunroy": " Good Day is one of the famous brand names of Britannia. It has some variants like Butter, Cashew, Badam Pista. It is a soft biscuit not crispy, and breaks very easily. Available in different packs. Normal pack is of 10 biscuits weighing 100 gm, packed by laminated wrapper. It has to be stored in an airtight container otherwise; it will become very soft like many other biscuits.Some useful information is printed on the wrapper, e.g.Weight \u2013 100 gmCalories \u2013 @ 505 KcalCarbohydrate \u2013 @ 62 gm / 100 gmProtein \u2013 @ 8 gm / 100 gmFat \u2013 @ 32 gm / 100 gmIngredients contain Wheat flour, Butter, Sugar, Milk and Milk Products, Salts, Permitted Flavour, colour etc. Cashew, Badam and Pista are also added as per variant name.So, it is a high calorie biscuit and most suitable for little naughty one. Addition of nutrients like badam, pista, butter, cashew makes it really enriched as claimed by Britannia. Taste is good.Let me share some of my observations \u2013A) Marketed by Britannia but manufactured by some other company as mentioned on the wrapper. Nowadays, that is the trend. Big one is out sourcing even their famous products. Britannia must have engaged their quality control people to check QUALITY and HYGIENE during third party production.B) Wrapped by Laminates \u2013 Laminates are made of plastic sheets with the help of laminating adhesives. These adhesives are normally twin system, one part is adhesive and the other part is hardener. There is possibility of migrating one of the components of adhesive system through thin plastic sheet to food. This migration may change taste, odour / flavour of the biscuit and it is harmful. Only food grade adhesives are recommended for food products. Management of Britannia must ensure use of food grade adhesives for laminates used for food products.Information to parents \u2013a) All biscuits contain Maida (Type of wheat flour) and it is not easy to digest unlike Atta. Due to this, a child may loose appetite if he consumes too many biscuits a day.b) Balanced food is essential. Therefore, only high calorie biscuit like Good Day does not serve the purpose. Vegetable, Milk, Fruit, Egg is essential.c) Most important \u2013 Infants may not be able to make out bad taste or odour of spoiled food.

Good Day, biscuits with butter,  is round and  somewhat thick. In terms of nutritional contents it is good. Good Day is good to start one's day good.The biscuit is particularly liked by children. It is not crisp, but is somewhat soft and  is easy to  bite. Earlier probably the product was available only in small packets. Now it is available in large packets also. Going by its label it is best before eight months from packaging. The package has the standard Bar Code.The package has the slogan Eat Healthy, Think Better. But the correlation between the two has not been established.", "my_sanshine": " Now, let me tell you how I fell head over heals with this pure magic treat.....Myself and my hubby were on our way to the airport to pick one of our friends. On the way, I was 'whining' that I was hungry. So he stopped at one of the small retail shops and after intense scrutinising of the biscuit section, I picked up 2 packs of Britannia Choconut Good Day biscuits. Well, what really made me buy this was the advertisement. I was asking myself,''now, is this biscuit that delicious?''. So anyway, happy that I had something to fill up my 'little tummy', we set off.I opened the pack very carefully (as my hubby will freak out if I spill any crumb of the biscuit on his 'darling' car). I had the 1st bite and I went...''this stuff is awesome....one of the best chocolate biscuits I have ever tasted....do you want some?''......my hubby, after checking whether I had spilt any crumbs in the car, said ''yeah..ok''.....so I popped one into his mouth.And that was the end of the 2 pack of biscuits. By the time we reached the airport, I alone finished one pack and finished the other pack by sharing it with my hubby. It was pure heaven....really very yummy yum.....But one thing to take note of..those who are health-freaks, should think twice on consuming this coz it's about 50 calories per biscuit. Boy! popping in 50 cal is so much easier than trying to burn it out....Ask me....I know what I go through to burn just 100 calories in the gym (but it's heaven to pop in 2X50 can choconut biscuits)So, I consume the biscuits when I feel that I deserve it.....like for e.g when I behave...Nah!....So go ahead.....have a treat...have a Choconut Good Day!", "newuser": " Hi friends!The word good day brings a taste of good day biscuits in my mouth :) I know, I know I am a foodomanic, but yes this one is my favourite biscuits. I used to eat a lot of biscuits when I was a child, but then stopped eating all of a sudden and now again have started because of just one day.One day in the morning I was extremely hungry and I asked for something to mom. I generally have tea and a glass of milk before leaving for work, so there was no brakfast and I was given Good day. And I opened the pack and simply took 2 biscuits and kept it back where it was. As I started to eat dipping it in tea, I was so happy with the taste. It was like heaven. :)I know you all might be laughing.... but thats the fact. suddenly thoughts came in my mind like.... ahhhh God gave us so much to eat.... so many varieties of food, etc. I even said it loud for my family members who laughed at it. And slowly in that heavenly feeling I gulped down the whole pack!It was simply wonderful to taste with that cashews coming in every now and then. They are filling too. As I didn't feel hungry at work ( I generally feel hungry all the time) ha ha ha.So I am very happy with Good day, makes my day! Its worth its price which is 12 Rs. and yes a good idea to carry it along with you. will help when you really need something...
