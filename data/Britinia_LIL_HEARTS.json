It is from Britannia so there is no question of inferior quality or taste.Cons: Over the time I think they have decreased the amount of sprinkled sugar.I want the old ones back which were sweet and yummy.Verdict: Don't buy it, leave all the packets for me:)", "sakshigoyal58": " These biscuits I have been eating since my childhood.Biscuit with sugar coating and with pinch of salt make it different from others.Even many biscuits came in market with this combination.

My affair with chotu started since my school days. In-between chotu was missing for sometime. But thank to whoever \u2013 I am happy that chotu is back again :)These biscuits are small heart shaped with fine sugar sprinkled on it and is baked to give a special treat to taste bud. Just one bite &amp; it just melts inside the mouth. The sugar on top doesn\u2019t make it too sweet but adds the special effect which makes one to say \u2018le gaya dil \u2013 chotu dil\u2019. Look wise this one is very different than the other ones. The top is having the brown lines with white in between. Another catch for this product is the packaging \u2013 the pouch pack, which was known specially for the wafers. The color combination of red &amp; golden on pouch is rather catchy. With those zigzag at both the end it is easy to open the pouch, reducing the chance of biscuit falling out.I remember seeing some other variants in-between, but never bothered to taste except the classic one. And right now I don\u2019t even see the other variants on shelf.I prefer to grab chotu not with milk / tea/ coffee \u2013 but just like that. But I always nag for the very little quantity. The size of the biscuit being small, its fun to gulp the entire biscuit but then shortly I find my fingers moving freely inside the pouch! Darn! It is over\u00a0:(\u00a0Good to have while net browsing, watching television or movie at home, easy serving during guest visit or even just like that!Well, I was able to grab some gyaan on chotu too.

The pack containing ample for one though, still seems a lil too less. I bet you have one, you will long for another one or two for sure. Lightly sprayed sugar coating on them makes the taste buds respond in affirmative the moment one puts them in mouth, and the texture and the little hearts are manufactured to such a finesse that they just simply melt in one's mouth, giving a momentary Nirvana!!!

The series of biscuits and types of flavours that the Company launches is fantastic.... The only problem that I face at times.. is non- availibility of Little Hearts.. at various vendors.. I am a big fan of this series of biscuits.. but whenever I inquire about Little Hearts is that the Company has stopped manufacturing the brand.......I find it very difficult to locate the biscuits......Would appreciate if this could be taken a proper feedback and implemented as well. All the series of biscuits... like Marie Gold, Good Day and Little Hearts etc....are too good!!!!! I would also like to say that in Comparison to other brands.. the prices are competitive and quality is excellent... I think the Management should concentrate more on the Supply Chain Services have to be streamlined a lot because a lot of times...Customers are at the receiving end if they do not get the the required brands in Britannia.The Vendors blame the Suppliers and inturn they blame the Wholesalers which is a continous and unresolved query.. specially in New Delhi... parts of West Delhi..Thanks for your time to read through this.....A valuable Customer..."}]
