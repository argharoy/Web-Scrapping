I love to dip this biscuit in my milk of glass. so put plastic tray in packet. mostly times shopkeeper threw the packet of biscuit from one place to other place, it is the reason for break this biscuit into pieces. when having tray inside packet them it wouldn't be broken into pieces.this is all I can say.thanks", "vedbageshwar": " My favorite bscucts is the Britannia 50 \u2013 50.Britannia 50 - 50 Biscuits is considered as common mans biscuit.

However these biscuits cannot be a meal replacement as they are very rich in simple carbohydrates and sugars. There is 44.53 gm of carbohydrates in just 65 gm serving of the biscuit of which 13 gm is sugar. For this reason, we do not consider this product to be a safe snack for people who suffer from lifestyle diseases like obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol imbalances and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.The foodnetindia rating for this product:-foodnetindia safety rating: 4 -(On a scale of 1 to 10 from very unsafe to very safe)This product is eaten in large quantities and regularly as a snack by adults and children alike. Very often, it is eaten as a meal replacement by people on the move. A high simple carb, and high sugar, high salt product like this is not safe when consumed in this fashion and may cause lifestyle diseases in adults. Even children must sparingly eat such starchy and sugary products.The amount of salt in this product is high at 195 mg in 36 gm of the product. Also one of the product ingredients is edible vegetable oil, and it is not specified by the manufacturer which oil is used.foodnetindia wholesomeness rating: 3 -(On a scale of 1 to 10 from very unbalanced nutrition profile to excellent nutrition profile)The product is a sugary starchy product with no macro nutrient balance or natural micronutrient diversity.

We believe that it is not responsible behaviour for a brand to avoid clearly stating what ingredients have been used.Certain vegetable oils contain very large amounts of biologically active fats called Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which could be harmful in excess. Excess polyunsaturated fats may react with oxygen and oxidised Omega-6 fats can damage body functions and perhaps even vital structures like DNA. In addition, consumers need clear information about the type of vegetable oil used, so that they can take action to maintain a healthy balance between Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acid consumption.In addition, some people may be allergic to specific oils. Food allergies can sometimes be life threatening.Invert SyrupInverted or invert sugar syrup is a mixture of glucose and fructose. It is used in several products such as honey, jam, golden syrup, etc. It is similar to high fructose corn syrup.High Fructose Corn Syrup is increasingly being seen as a reason for the high incidence of metabolic diseases. It has negative metabolic effects at much smaller doses than sucrose.Edible Common SaltIn 36 gm of Britannia 50 50 biscuits there is 195 mg of Salt which is very high. High sodium diets have been known to be the cause of high blood pressure, heart disease, etc. The recommended daily intake of salt is between 1-3 grams.SugarBritannia 50 50 contains 13 gm sugar per 65 gm of the product. This food product does not specify which sugar has been used. This is important because different sugars have different metabolic effects. For example, Sucrose(Cane Sugar) is very different from Fructose(Fruit Sugar). Some foods use high fructose corn syrup which may be harmful in much lower quantities than sucrose.  We believe that it is not responsible behaviour for a brand to not clearly state what ingredients have been used.Raising agentIN 503(ii)(ammonium bicarbonate)It is produced from ammonium sulphate and calcium carbonate, natural minerals. It is used as a acidity regulator, alkali, and rising agent. Side effects may be gas formation in the stomach after ingestion.Added Flavours(Artificial flavouring substances Butter, Vanilla, Milk)This food product does not specify which flavours or flavouring substances have been used.

I was so sure that this brand's salted biscuits would be as fresh and tasty, as the sweet biscuits.While sampling a specific brand of salted biscuits for the first time, I keep the following factors in mind: taste, freshness and method of preparation(whether baked or fried).For starters, I bought a 50 gram packet of 50-50. As a consumer, 50-50's taste as a biscuit was nothing to write home about(I could have sworn that this biscuit was both sweet and salty, to taste!), especially since I have been spoiled by Parle's excellent range of salted biscuits!Second, I really did not appreciate the fact that my fingers had been coated by an oily residue left by the biscuits, while handling them! Personally, I like my biscuits baked, not fried!Third, within 72 hours of emptying the biscuits into an air tight plastic container(I also made sure to close the lid tightly to prevent any air from getting into the container), the biscuits became stale! Mind you, this happened on two separate occasions! I have no idea how that was even possible as I have stored other brands of biscuits like Milk Bikis, Cheeselings, etc. in the same type of plastic containers and these biscuits(thankfully!) remained fresh, at least for a couple of weeks!I was happy that I had bought only a 50 gram packet of 50-50 biscuits, as this packet costed just Rs. 10 and did not burn much of a hole in my pocket!"}], {"delmatfel": " Britania fifty fifty is legendary tasty biscuit I am a fan from childhood.That perfect blend of sweet and salt wow this is a winner.Cheaper on the pocket and so useful in long journeys.I uses to eat this as lunch when I an on train.This is a must for me when watching cricket in tv.My girlfriend is also a big fan of this .So we enjoy eating together .", "Reviewer2016": " Crispy and very tasty biscuit.

Bis means Twice and Coctus means Baked. Hence \u201cBiscotti\u201d transformed to Biscuit. You may call it cookie, sweety / salty thin flour wafer etc. Just like the cast / creed, sects existing among human beings, you will come across blonde, dark, brown, salty, sour and sweet and another zillion varieties of biscuits across the globe.At times, it carries the dollop of gooey and syrupy cream or at times it will manifest as in a raw form of baked flour without any taste or odour. It is a unique food item that will be served to you and your doggie. In short, there is a bit of biscuit in everyone\u2019s life.  When Roman Chef Apicus invented the forefather of the modern day biscuit, he might not have even thought of the metamorphic and cataclysmic mutation that is going to happen to his brain child.Why 50-50How to choose a biscuit? Well, answer is very simple. Choose what is good for you and do not worry much about the ingredients. Obsessive compulsive calorie consciousness could be a stumbling block while exploring variety but still some general principle I follow \u2013Diet FriendlyIt shall not kill the appetite. Some biscuits can derail your metabolic activity that might trigger the acidic imbalance and finally you will skip your meal. Side effects and long term health hazards are many. As we are all having a unique biological system, trial and error is the best method to arrive at your decision. Anything carrying nut, cream, chocolate etc. could be detrimental to me.Value for MoneyDo not pay for the packing but for the content. You can spend Rs.110/- for the Honey and Oats Biscuit from Cafe Coffee Day and own the fancy cylindrical shaped tin. Well, it is not your main course or it is not vital or essential food and hence do choose the one which will offer you best and diet friendly productWell, I got the answer in 1993. At first it was \u201cLittle Hearts\u201d from Britannia came in pouch packs. It has got multiple utilities also like presenting a little heart to the girl next door can be the most docile way of expressing your puppy love. But again it melted so fast and the syrupy taste was not appealing for long. Well, still \u201cDil Sab ka actually sweet hai\u201dFinally I got acquainted with 50-50 from the same brand. It came in a simple and humble pack and never professed to offer anything more. It melts with a gentle speed but provide a taste that last for a while. We feel like having a biscuit but it never fill your stomach. You can have four to five but still have a peaceful life without acidity or vociferous burps.Revolution in Cracker FamilyThere could be more reasons why this INR 5 pack of biscuit became my best packaged food for long. I had a couple of biscuits belonging to cracker family (50-50 is belonging to this variety of biscuits which is simple in composition, mostly flour, water and any sweetening agent. It is inexpensive and long lasting and is usually used by those who are engaged in expedition, military troop in action, sailors). All of them were good enough but in our country, the real revolution happened when a value added cracker product is introduced which appeals to mass. In a way, this product silently eradicated the stigma associated with an \u201cinexpensive\u201d product. No wonder, they still hold one third of the market share in this segment in the countryProduct StabilityOf course, they have ventured into a niche market of hardtack variety which is considered to be down market. But for the last sixteen years, this is one product where in the company did not have to venture into product modification or marketing strategy. In the year 2001, they have come up with the first variant \u201cMaska Chaska\u201d and even this was widely accepted. Again, it is not a major variation from the existing vintage product. Here you can find the \u201ccracker\u201d having some features of \u201ccookie\u201dTaste I tried to read the ingredients description in the packet and came to know that they used to add sesame seed and pepper along with sweetening agent, diary components etc. It melts so soon but still in a moment\u2019s time, you will get to feel the sweet, salt and the taste of some herb (that is filling the docking-hole of the biscuit). It is not like any other variety that offers a uniform taste. It is so gentle but distinct. To sum up, you shall not be an analytical champion when it comes to choose a biscuit. At times, familiarity can breed contempt. It is like \"know biscuit and no biscuit\".  But often the gut churns when we identify something unique and appealing. I am having a penchant towards earthy and simple stuffs and here I got this companion. So, what are you waiting for, let us have a cup of tea and cracker!", "swtneha31": " Hi all,When I was a kid from school snacks and brunch was not in fashion and we only had biscuits and tea or milk for our snacks. I always liked munching all the timeThat time we sometimes had Krackjack. A similar biscuit was evolved that time named as 50-50. I really loved its taste very much. Its little salty little sweet taste and crunchiness is the USP of this biscuit. My family loved it a lot.Now after marriage I don't get this biscuit here in my locality so I have Horlicks biscuits with my tea. But the taste of 50-50 is incomparable.", "Aniket22": " When we think of Biscuits we Think of some sweet cream ones or some cookies to enjoy during tea time.

But dont know why when I start eating it. I finished the pack in one go. and then I feel that. I eat the whole pack. I want more. may be this happens because the biscuits are so light.Eat it. Crunch it. Enjoy it.", "simranxyz": " Normally, I hate biscuits, chips and other such fad foods. You never really know what goes into its making, but you always get addicted to it, you cant eat just one.But Britannia 50-50 Maska Chaska, is it just a biscuit? I am not talking about the normal variety, which I feel is a blind but pathetic imitation of the age-old Parle Krackjack. I am referring to the green variety, which is a lot better innovation from the Britannia family.FlavorThis biscuit is so light, thin and flaky, it just melts in your mouth. The taste is something between sweet and salty, but there is some other flavor to it that is quite appealing. Some herbs they add to this biscuit and appears in it as green speckles is giving this biscuit its cutting edge. So addictive is this biscuit that you no have to worry about storing the pack, once it is opened.Health WiseWell, unless you are health conscious, I recommend you not to read the nutritional information on the cover. 100g of the biscuit contains60g Carbohydrates,7.8g Protein,210mg Calciumand a whopping 27g FAT.......That means 1/4 of what you eat goes directly into your fat cells. Maybe thats what makes them so tasty.IngredientsHere is a list of other ingredients in the biscuit.Wheat flourEdible Vegetable OilsSugarLiquid GlucoseLeavening agentsButterMilk &amp; Milk ProductsSaltEdible Vegetable Product (?)CalciumDough Conditioners (E-223, Enzyme)Added flavor (butter)Permitted Antioxidant (E-320)PackagingIt comes in a silver and green glistening wrap.

You can tame both of them with it.", "tanaykochrekar": "  Shortest Commodity Reviews:\u00a0\u00a0Britannia 50-50To compete against Parle\u2019s Krack Jack, here comes Britannia 50-50. It\u2019s not only sweet but kind of salty as well, so it goes on the lines of Monaco in taste and Krack Jack in shape.This product, if you\u2019ve eaten Monaco Biscuits first tastes very bland.
